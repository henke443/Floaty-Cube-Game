# Floaty-Cube-Game
This is a small SFML game I made 2019. I think it's very fun and addicting but I shelved it and haven't touched it since. It would be amazing if someone helped me tidy some things up, especially physics related things, enable touch support and publish it as a mobile game. If you want to help me out I'm eternally grateful
