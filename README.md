# Floaty-Cube-Game
This is a small SFML game I made 2019. It was very fun to program but I shelved it and haven't touched it since. It would be extremely fun to tidy some things up, especially some physics related things, enable touch support and publish it as a mobile game. If you want to help me out I'm eternally grateful
